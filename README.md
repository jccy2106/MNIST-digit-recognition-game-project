Pygame + Tensorflow

This is a small beginner's project made with pygame and tensorflow. 
In brain.py is a simple sequential neural network trained
on the MNIST dataset using tensorflow's keras built-in layers.
I used pygame to write a simple program where players can draw 
a digit from 1-9 and then then it will predict the drawn number 
based on the train data.
